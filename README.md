# QT MySQL login application

Application created for CSC 3380 that prompts user for their username and password.

Note: This is not production code. The MySQL host, username and password are hardcoded into the MySQL class implementation. Also, no encryption is being used for the passwords. This was done intentionally for the sake of time, simplicity, and prototyping.
